# Transformers
This was my project for NLP class in my university.
My goal was creating a kind of translater from English to Russian with Transformers. 
Data was collected by me. More info about it, you can find in the Dataset folder.
The architecture of Transformers, you can find here: Attention is all you need(https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
I also used tutorials from Youtube, big thanks to Andrej Kapathy(https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) and CodeEmporium (https://www.youtube.com/@CodeEmporium)
