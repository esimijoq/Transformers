These are the short stories of O. Henry in English and Rusiian collected from different sources. I did not translate them. 
In 2 txt files, there are around 30 stories in each file. 
In Dataset file, there are only 3-4 stories but almost each sentence is in each row. 
In 1st column you can find English version of the sentence and in the 2nd column the Russian translation of the sentence.

The dataset is not perfert and quite small.
I am going to update all my files adding more stories. But for now, please feel free to use it.
